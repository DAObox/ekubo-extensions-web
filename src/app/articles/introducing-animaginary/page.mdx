Traditional companies have formalized structures and centralized leadership. But emerging Web3 technologies allow creating decentralized organizational models - like DAOs powered by smart contracts - that mirror real-world entities.

To make this possible, we needed to squeeze every drop of performance out of the browser possible. And so Animaginary was born.

{/* ```js
import { animate } from '@planetaria/animaginary'

export function MyComponent({ open, children }) {
  return (
    <animate.div
      in={open}
      animateFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
      animateTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
      duration={350}
    >
      {children}
    </animate.div>
  )
}
``` */}


## Building On-Chain Organizations

Web3 organizations leverage the power of blockchain technology and smart contracts to create decentralized and autonomous entities. These organizations operate on the principles of transparency, trustlessness, and immutability. By utilizing blockchain, on-chain organizations can streamline processes, facilitate efficient decision-making, and ensure the integrity of transactions.

## Challenges and Limitations

While on-chain organizations offer numerous advantages, they also come with their own set of challenges and limitations. One of the main challenges is scalability. As more participants join the network, the scalability of on-chain organizations becomes a critical factor. Additionally, the complexity of smart contracts and the need for robust security measures pose challenges in the development and maintenance of on-chain organizations.

## The Future of On-Chain Organizations

Despite the challenges, the future of on-chain organizations looks promising. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, scalability solutions such as layer 2 protocols and sharding are being developed to address the scalability issue. Moreover, advancements in smart contract programming languages and tools will simplify the development process and enhance the security of on-chain organizations. With these advancements, on-chain organizations have the potential to revolutionize various industries and reshape traditional organizational structures.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building Web3 organizations that mirror real-world entities through on-chain organizations powered by smart contracts is an exciting and transformative concept. While challenges exist, the future prospects are bright. As blockchain technology and smart contracts continue to evolve, we can expect on-chain organizations to play a significant role in shaping the future of decentralized and autonomous entities.
