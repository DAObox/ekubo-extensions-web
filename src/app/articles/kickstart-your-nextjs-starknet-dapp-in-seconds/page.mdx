As a developer in the web3 space, I see great value in having templates to streamline the initial setup when starting new projects. <a href='https://starknet-react.com/docs/getting-started' target='_blank'>Starknet React</a> library offers a library of React hooks and a Next.js and Vite template that can accelerate scarfolding of frontend Starknet dApps. This un-opinionated starter kit provides the essential Starknet React dependencies to get up and running quickly.

## Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with React or Next.js fundamentals.

## Getting Started

### Project Setup

When launching a new Starknet dApp project, I highly recommend using the `create-starknet` template:

```bash
pnpm create starknet
```

*You can also use `npm` or `yarn` as your package manager of choice*

This will scaffold a Next.js app with Starknet React and its peer dependencies pre-installed. The template offers a minimal setup so you can build the dApp how you see fit.
